## Python Environment Setup and Management with uv
Make sure to have uv installed: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

After cloning the repository,  create the python environment with all dependencies based on the `.python-version`, `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files by running
```bash
uv sync
```

To add new dependencies, use
```bash
uv add <package>
```
which will add the package to `pyproject.toml` and update the `uv.lock` file. You can also specify a version, e.g. `uv add pandas==2.0.3`.

Remove packages with
```bash
uv remove <package>
```

Commit changes to `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files into version control.

Run `uv sync` after pulling changes to update the local environment.
